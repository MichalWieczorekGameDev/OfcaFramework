# OfcaFramework V0.1
 Here is my framework for Unity engine based on the idea of ScriptableObject Architecture Pattern and other solutions.  At this moment the framework is under further development. I am making it available as part of my portfolio.
 The main goal of this repository is to create a framework that will allow me to create fully functional games very easily without having to worry about writing scripts from scratch, as well as provide me with the best possible fast design, prototyping and testing.

I am developing this framework based on some external assets from Unity Asset Store:
- Odin Inspector and Serializer https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041
